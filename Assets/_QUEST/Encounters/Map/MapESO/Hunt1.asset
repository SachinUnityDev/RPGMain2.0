  descTxt: You've covered quite a distance from the city, and now you find yourself
    in the heart of the wilderness. The savannah stretches out before you, untamed
    and pristine like the lands of the first men. You have the urge to press forward,
    but you're also aware that continuing might lead to unwelcome consequences. Are
    you bold enough to proceed?
  choiceAStr: Continue
