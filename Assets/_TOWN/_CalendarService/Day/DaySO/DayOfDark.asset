  dayDescription: 
  tipOfTheDayList:
  - 'Nightclaw, Moon Acolyte and even Macalakies are some companions that could be
    used more efficiently at night time compared to day. '
  - 'Sewers, Caves and Subteranean scenes have no day and night cycle. Thus the night
    bonuses nor handicaps will be active for them. '
  - 'It is not difficult to measure an NPC behaviour from the way they talk. Some
    of them like heroes while some of them respect the villains more. Better choose
    a path and move on it rather than keep lurking in the grey area. '
