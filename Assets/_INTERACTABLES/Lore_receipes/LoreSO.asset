      Loretxt: "There is a common confusion regarding the name Elamia itself. It
        is known as the peninsula in the south of Shargad that lies to the west of
        Kujmar and east of Safrima \u2013 between Sea of Sides and Swallowing Sea.
        The peninsula contains various other lands such as Macanegheri in the west,
        Greenhearth in the east and some part of Kugharia in the north. But the most
        important one is Ancient Elamia, a peninsula of its own to the south of the
        main peninsula, which is the main source of the confusion. Some say, it is
        the cradle of civizilation. \r\n\r\nAncient Elamia is the only piece of land
        in Shargad where Humans are not the rulers despite of being the majority
        of the population. Elamians, or the Elami as some may refer to, are mix of
        many different ethnicities of the ancient Human tribes. They are called as
        \u201CSmallheads\u201D by the Aqrabulu, a half human half scorpio race who
        are the rulers of Elamia for a long long time. So many local lodges and cults
        are run by Aqrabulu sheikhs in the land and the supreme ruler of Anicent
        Elamia is called \u201Cthe Lughal\u201D who is always choosen from the Aqrabulu
        race without exception and supported by the High Council which is a group
        of ministers to help Lughal in his rule. Lughal, also known as God-king resides
        in desert city of Nabil Sha\u2019ar, also known as Wonderous City for its
        capability to survive in the middle of desert and being the largest city
        in Shargad. He rules the nation from his ziggurat, sitting in his large throne
        constructed to perfectly fit the lower body of an Aqrabulu. However, it is
        rumoured that there is a greater force beyond the reaches of God-king and
        the High Council which makes the ultimate decisions for the land.\r\n"

        Island. The humans of the land prefer to call it Galmartu, after the ancient
        human tribes which has settled on the land while elves prefer the name Shamrock.\r\n\r\nThis
        is a land famous with the heavy rains, greenery, lakes and rivers. The northwest
        side of the island is ruled by Forest Elves and has thousands of lakes. Most
        travelers say the region is a natural wonder by default but hard place to
        live. Not so hard for the tree-shaping skilled\r\nelves though. Their city
        is named Hazel Grove.\r\n\r\nDwarves are another skilled folk of the region
        who live underground \u2013in the city of Madder\u2019adder- and known as
        either Deep Dwarves or Madder Dwarves. Otso \u2013 the werebears are the
        third non-human folk in the land. They live in the forest in the hidden city
        named as Torula, close to center of the island.\r\n\r\nThere are two baronies
        who possess the main power of the land, who are constantly in conflict not
        only among themselves but other races as well. The Barony of Water Horse
        call themselves Highlanders and the Barony of Teal Seal Lowlanders. City
        of the former is called Dun Creagach, a castle set right near the cliffs
        and the later is Caermirddyn. The free city of Saor is the last city on the
        island which is set up on the coast and mostly run by thieves, pirates and
        outlaws. \r\n"

        of the population are Galuneros; the human ethnicities famous with their
        street music and dance called \u201Cpajarillo\u201D. They have bronze skin
        and brunette hair, much alike with Dorians, the southerners of the land,
        whom they share the same blood but different cultures and tongue. Galuneros
        call Dorians as \u201Cthe Mountain People\u201D or \u201Csoutherners\u201D,
        while Dorians call Galuneros as \u201CThigganos\u201D - a made up word used
        just to insult them.\r\n\r\nAround the main island there are hundreds of
        small islands and some bigger group of islands, most famous one being the
        Robin Islands, the group of isles on the Immortal Sea between Galunas and
        Safrima. The large range of islands starting from Robin Islands reaching
        to the other side of Galunas through the north of island, are known as Alerion
        colonies which were main ports of trade ruled by wealthy merchants who call
        themselves as Sons of Alerion. They don\u2019t accept themselves as Galuneros
        and they claim to take their roots from a distinct and superior ethnicity
        of Humans. Some historians found traces of cultural familiarity and kinship
        between them and the Blackbirds. \r\n\r\nApart from the Human groups there
        are also minority of other races in Galunas. Orcs of the Desert are the largest
        group of folks with dark yellow skin who lives in the southwestern part of
        the island in a semi desert landscape. Dune Goblins are the tricky folk some
        of whom live in the cities together with Galuneros while others are notorious
        of being the bandits of region. Ipotans are the third minority who live in
        region of Doria, in a coastal town called Pillion. They don\u2019t leave
        the town and mix with Humans much and try to remain neutral in their relations
        with them as there is an obvious tension between Humans and Orcs of the Desert.
        \r\n\r\nOrcs of the Valley who lives in the Iron Valley across the Immortal
        Sea, are less conservative than their kin of the desert and doesn\u2019t
        limit themselves to live in their hometown as they travel across cities of
        Galunas in order to work or trade. Most become servants and guards to royal
        houses, while some work as Smiths, Carpenters and other professions which
        require physical prowess. \r\n\r\nOn top of all of that, not only orcs but
        a diversity of races and cultures travel to Galunas in hopes of becoming
        an athlete, a competer in the arenas of Galunas and rising to glory. Arena
        battles between various houses constitute the center of entertainment culture
        in Galunas while some dreamers claim this mere savagery has to be stopped
        immediately. A secret cult known as the Inquisitors has another idea: anyone
        whose race is not called Human must either serve as a slave or die!\r\n"

        are two large settlements in Greenhearth. One of them is named Afarcity by
        the Abzazulues just because it is far from the mainland. The other city is

        the peak of a large mountain range which acts as a border between south of

        Unlike their kin from Barlaew, they live as a matriarchial society ruled
