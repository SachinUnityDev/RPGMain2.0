  tipOfTheDayList:
  - 'Day is a good time for a man to work and provide. There are no professions to
    work during night time anyways. '
  - Everyone needs a hero; at least the ones who are too lazy to move their ass and
    do something for themselves. It is up to you how you wanna spread your fame in
    the land. But know this; every rose has its thorns.
