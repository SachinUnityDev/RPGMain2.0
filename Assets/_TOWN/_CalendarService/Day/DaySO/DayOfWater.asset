  tipOfTheDayList:
  - Long reads of NPCs are really boring. However, your patience might be rewarded
    at times.
  - Rainforests have some rainy days. This means both your party and the enemy party
    will be soaked during the time. Some companions like the Water Mage might act
    more powerful in such condition.
