  descTxt: 'When you pass by the docks, you hear some sounds - from a quarrel undoubtedly.

    As
    you approach the ship, you witness the fight between an Abzazulu and the crew.
    Then you dart into the fray - with good intentions of course. But the sides don''t
    seem to be settling down easily. You have to choose a side.'
