  descTxt: A good looking woman with pointy ears and coffee skin just passed near
    you. You can feel the heat surging through her body. You realized she could be
    a priestess from the way she dressed. She approached you and started talking
    in a whispering tone. "I frequently see you around the Temple of Shalulu stranger.
    I guess you don't need the blessing of Nusku?"
  choiceAStr: Be kind to her
  choiceBStr: Be just a little unkind
